# FirePendant

Fire pendant jewelry for Adafruit Feather MO + Charlieplex LED array. Loops a canned animation sequence on the display.

Arduino sketch is comprised of 'FirePendant.ino' and 'data.h' -- latter contains animation frames packed into PROGMEM array holding bounding rectangle + column-major pixel data for each frame (consumes most of the flash space on the ATmega328).

The 'frames.zip' archive contains the animation source PNG images and a python script, convert.py, which processes all the source images into the required data.h  format. The PNG images were generated via Adobe Premiere and Photoshop from Free Stock Video by user 'dietolog' on Videezy.com.
